# DESKTOP Journal and playbook

## In order to be able to track my steps through a full installation and configuration of a workstation

What I want with this is actualy a sort of playbook with all the software I have installed 
and specific configuration that I did to my desktop/notebook, so I can quickly 
replay those actions on another system. 

## Examples

- Java installation
- Flash installation
- Installing a new trusted root certificate
- Installing specific Gnome extensions
- All the little things that once installed become part of my daily habbits using them

For windows systems this is not necessarily needed because I can keep a folder structure with all the   
tools I need to install, a folder structure that if kept well organized and documented will be enough. 

In case of linux systems is not allways about just installing a software, and even if it is about installing 
a package most of the installations are done from repository, and I cannot remember all the useful packages 
I have found in the past in the repository, that's why I want to keep a list like this one with 
package names and installation instructions.
