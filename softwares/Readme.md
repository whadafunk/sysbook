## reviews and tips for server software
![Cover Photo](./cover_photo.jpg)

I will be reviewing here apps and services that I find useful and worthy of my time. 
I am targeting mostly opensource stuff, and mostly on-prem stuff solutions 
but it can be also cloud services and tools.
 
Part of this, would be a backlog of products that I intend to learn or implement at some point, 
while others would be solutions that I have implemented and experimented.
 
 To give you a couple of examples:
 
 
- Snort
- Suricata
- SecurityOnion
- Nagios
- Apache Guacamole
- Gitea
- ElasticSearch
- Logstash

### What I usually do is to have bookmarks to these product pages, and my experience with the product.
